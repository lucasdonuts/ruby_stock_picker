User inputs an array representing stock prices on given days
Iterate through each day
  For each day, evaluate possible profit if sold on each other day in the array
    Save the results of each comparison into a new array, probably multi-dimensional
    Each index of the comparison array will contain profit amount, buy day, and sell day

Iterate through comparison array and determine which result has the best profit value
